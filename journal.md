# This is my journal for info-science

1/31
1. what did you do? 
- I did programing instractions.
2. what did you learn? 
- I learned the basic logic of computer science.
3. what questions do I have? 
- I'm still unsure that how each programing language relates to the basic logic.

# Solution to the homework
I made my initial only using triangles
```.py
triangle(30, 20, 58, 20, 58, 75);
triangle(30, 75, 30, 20, 58, 75);
triangle(68, 75, 68, 20, 68, 75);
triangle(68, 75, 68, 20, 68, 20);
```

 1. what did you do? 
 - I made circle and made radiation patture with circles with colers
 2. what did you learn? 
 - I learned how to define the size of the square, its location, X and Y coordinates and its color.
 3. what questions do I have? 
 - I'm still having troube with defining X and Y coordinates when creating one side of dice.

# Solution to the homework
I made 1 side dice.
```.py
def setup():
    size(600, 600)
    background(255)
    square(40, 40, 400)
    
    ellipse(120, 120, 80, 80)
    ellipse(120, 240, 80, 80)
    ellipse(120, 360, 80, 80)
    ellipse(360, 120, 80, 80)
    ellipse(360, 240, 80, 80)
    ellipse(360, 360, 80, 80)
    ellipse(240, 240, 80, 80)
    ```

1. what did you do? 
- I did programing of mouseClicked dice.
2. what did you learn? 
- I learned how to set mouseClicked and change the coler of the circle.
3. what questions do I have? 
- I'm still unsure the difference bitween ellipce and circle.
